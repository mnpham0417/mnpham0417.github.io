I am a second year Ph.D. Candidate at New York University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chinmay Hegde](https://chinmayhegde.github.io), and part of the [Algorithms and Foundations Group](https://csefoundations.engineering.nyu.edu). Prior to this, I obtained dual Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of being mentored by Prof. [Jacob Whitehill](https://users.wpi.edu/~jrwhitehill/).

**Research:** The goal of my research is to build algorithms that make deep neural networks safer and easier to use. In particular, my current works center on understanding memorization in text-to-image generative models and how to mitigate it. Furthermore, I have dedicated efforts to fortify DNNs against adversarial attacks, distributional shifts, and label noise.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
