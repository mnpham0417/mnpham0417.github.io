<span style="color: red;">I expect to graduate in 2026 and am actively seeking research scientist/engineer positions. If my expertise aligns with your needs, please feel free to contact me via email to request my latest resume.</span>

I am a final year Ph.D. Candidate at New York University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chinmay Hegde](https://chinmayhegde.github.io), and part of the [Algorithms and Foundations Group](https://csefoundations.engineering.nyu.edu). Prior to this, I obtained dual Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of being mentored by [Prof. Jacob Whitehill](https://users.wpi.edu/~jrwhitehill/).

**Research:** The goal of my research is to build algorithms that make deep neural networks safer and easier to use. In particular, my current works center on understanding memorization in text-to-image generative models and how to mitigate it. Furthermore, I have dedicated efforts to fortify DNNs against adversarial attacks, distributional shifts, and label noise.
